Hi John,

Nice job on your portfolio project review! I'm excited to meet again and discuss your app further. To recap, before the next time we meet:

- Comb over your routes to make sure you are using RESTful conventions where appropriate. A good reference for this lives here: https://learn.co/tracks/full-stack-web-development-v5/sinatra/activerecord/sinatra-restful-routes
- Review has_secure_password. Focus on the methods it provides and what they do for us and our apps.

- Review sessions. Why do we set session[:user_id]?

- Look into using Enrollments as a join table. Remember that you can specify the class you'll be referencing: http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#options-for-belongs-to-class-name
- If you're having trouble, don't hesitate to schedule a 1:1 with Howard! https://theflatironschool.typeform.com/to/Xva2Br
When you've finished, you can use this link to schedule another appointment: https://meetme.so/SinatraLearnAssessment
Please reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

Regards,
