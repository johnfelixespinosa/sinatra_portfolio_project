  This Sinatra App serves as a semester planner for students. Its main purpose is for students to be able to create and account and then add classes to a schedule. The schedule is then created listing all of their chosen classes for that semester with the ability to edit and/or delete classes. Students should have the ability to create multiple schedules planning for future semesters.
